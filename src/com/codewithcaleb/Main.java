        //Other Programming Languages are More linient but Java is Not
        String name ="CALEB";

        //2.We must terminate our Statements with semi Colons unless we are defining a code block
        int Age = 12;

        //3.When we are calling methods we must always include a paranthesis.
        System.out.println();


        //4 Strings in Java are represented by Double Quotes
        //Single quotes are reserved for Characters unlike in other Languages like Python

        //5 Java is Case sensitive so we Must always ensure that our variables are named correctly

        //6.We cannot name our variables using keywords/ such as class

        //7 We cannot use a single equals sign to compare values
        //There is a big difference between one equals sign and two equals sign in Java.
